## Part I: Increase Our Faith

### Section 1: The Whole Armour of God

#### Lesson 1: Psalm 27

    [1] The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is
    the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

    [2] When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
    my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

    [3] Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
    though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

    [4] One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I
    may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the
    beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

    [5] For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the
    secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.

    [6] And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me:
    therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing,
    yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

    [7] Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and
    answer me.

    [8] When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face,
    LORD, will I seek.

    [9] Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou
    hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.

    [10] When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me
    up.

    [11] Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine
    enemies.

    [12] Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses
    are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

    [13] I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD
    in the land of the living.

    [14] Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
    heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

#### Lesson 2: Psalm 91

    [1] He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
    the shadow of the Almighty.

    [2] I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him
    will I trust.

    [3] Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the
    noisome pestilence.

    [4] He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
    trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
    
    [5] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow
    that flieth by day;
    
    [6] Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
    destruction that wasteth at noonday.
    
    [7] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
    but it shall not come nigh thee.
    
    [8] Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
    wicked.
    
    [9] Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most
    High, thy habitation;
    
    [10] There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
    thy dwelling.
    
    [11] For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy
    ways.
    
    [12] They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
    against a stone.
    
    [13] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
    dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
    
    [14] Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I
    will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
    
    [15] He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
    trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
    
    [16] With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
