### Section 1: Psalms

#### Lesson 1: Psalm 91

    [1] He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
    the shadow of the Almighty.

    [2] I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him
    will I trust.

    [3] Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the
    noisome pestilence.

    [4] He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
    trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
    
    [5] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow
    that flieth by day;
    
    [6] Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
    destruction that wasteth at noonday.
    
    [7] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
    but it shall not come nigh thee.
    
    [8] Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
    wicked.
    
    [9] Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most
    High, thy habitation;
    
    [10] There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
    thy dwelling.
    
    [11] For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy
    ways.
    
    [12] They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
    against a stone.
    
    [13] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
    dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
    
    [14] Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I
    will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
    
    [15] He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
    trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
    
    [16] With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

#### Lesson 2: Psalm 35

    [1] Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me; fight against them 
    that fight against me.

    [2] Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

    [3] Draw out also the spear, and block the way against them that persecute 
    me. Say unto my soul, "I am thy salvation."

    [4] Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul; let them 
    be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

    [5] Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the angel of the Lord chase 
    them.

    [6] Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the angel of the Lord persecute 
    them.

    [7] For without cause they have hid their net for me in a pit, which without 
    cause they have dug for my soul.

    [8] Let destruction come upon him unawares; and let the net which he hath hidden 
    catch himself; into that very destruction let him fall.

    [9] Then my soul shall be joyful in the Lord; it shall rejoice in His salvation.

    [10] All my bones shall say, "Lord, who is like unto Thee, who deliverest the 
    poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and needy from him that 
    would plunder him?"

    [11] False witnesses rose up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.

    [12] They rewarded me evil for good, to the grieving of my soul.

    [13] But as for me, when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my 
    soul with fasting, and my prayer returned unto mine own bosom.

    [14] I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother; I bowed down 
    in heaviness, as one that mourneth for his mother.

    [15] But in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together; yea, 
    the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they tore 
    at me and ceased not.

    [16] With hypocritical mockers at feasts they gnashed their teeth against me.

    [17] Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, 
    my precious soul from the lions.

    [18] I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among 
    many people.

    [19] Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; neither let 
    them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

    [20] For they speak not peace, but they devise deceitful matters against them 
    that are quiet in the land.

    [21] Yea, they opened their mouths wide against me and said, "Aha, aha! Our eyes 
    have seen it."

    [22] This Thou hast seen, O Lord; keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.

    [23] Stir up Thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and 
    my Lord.

    [24] Judge me, O Lord my God, according to Thy righteousness; and let them not 
    rejoice over me.

    [25] Let them not say in their hearts, “Ah, so would we have it!” Let them not 
    say, “We have swallowed him up.”

    [26] Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at my 
    hurt; let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves 
    against me.

    [27] Let them shout for joy and be glad that favor my righteous cause; yea, 
    let them say continually, "Let the Lord be magnified who hath pleasure in the 
    prosperity of His servant."

    [28] And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness and of Thy praise all the 
    day long.

### Section 2: Revelations

#### Lesson 1: Revelations 6:1-8

    [1] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it 
    were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.

    [2] And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; 
    and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

    [3] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, 
    Come and see. 

    [4] And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to 
    him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill 
    one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.

    [5] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, 
    Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had 
    a pair of balances in his hand.

    [6] And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of 
    wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou 
    hurt not the oil and the wine.

    [7] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth 
    beast say, Come and see.

    [8] And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was 
    Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the 
    fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with 
    death, and with the beasts of the earth.

#### Lesson 2: Revelation 12:1-6

    [1] And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the 
    sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

    [2] And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be 
    delivered.

    [3] And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red 
    dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

    [4] And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast 
    them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready 
    to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

    [5] And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a 
    rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

    [6] And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place 
    prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and 
    threescore days.

#### Lesson 3: Revelation 21:10-21

    [10] And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and
    shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
    
    [11] Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, 
    even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
    
    [12] And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates 
    twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve 
    tribes of the children of Israel:
    
    [13] On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; 
    and on the west three gates.
    
    [14] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of 
    the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
    
    [15] And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the 
    gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
    
    [16] And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: 
    and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length 
    and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
    
    [17] And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, 
    according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
    
    [18] And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure 
    gold, like unto clear glass.
    
    [19] And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner 
    of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the 
    third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
    
    [20] The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, 
    beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; 
    the twelfth, an amethyst.
    
    [21] And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one 
    pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
