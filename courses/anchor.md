#### Lesson 1: Psalm 91

    [1] He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
    the shadow of the Almighty.

    [2] I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him
    will I trust.

    [3] Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the
    noisome pestilence.

    [4] He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
    trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
    
    [5] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow
    that flieth by day;
    
    [6] Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
    destruction that wasteth at noonday.
    
    [7] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
    but it shall not come nigh thee.
    
    [8] Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
    wicked.
    
    [9] Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most
    High, thy habitation;
    
    [10] There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
    thy dwelling.
    
    [11] For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy
    ways.
    
    [12] They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
    against a stone.
    
    [13] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
    dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
    
    [14] Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I
    will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
    
    [15] He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
    trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
    
    [16] With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

#### Lesson 2: Revelations 6:1-8

    [1] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it 
    were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.

    [2] And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; 
    and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
    
    [3] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, 
    Come and see.
    
    [4] And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to 
    him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill 
    one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
    
    [5] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, 
    Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had 
    a pair of balances in his hand.
    
    [6] And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of 
    wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou 
    hurt not the oil and the wine.
    
    [7] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth 
    beast say, Come and see.
    
    [8] And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was 
    Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the 
    fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with 
    death, and with the beasts of the earth.


#### Lesson 3: Revelation 12:1-6

    [1] And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the 
    sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

    [2] And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be 
    delivered.

    [3] And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red 
    dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

    [4] And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast 
    them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready 
    to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

    [5] And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a 
    rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

    [6] And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place 
    prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and 
    threescore days.

#### Lesson 4: Revelation 21:10-21

    [10] And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and
    shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
    
    [11] Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, 
    even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
    
    [12] And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates 
    twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve 
    tribes of the children of Israel:
    
    [13] On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; 
    and on the west three gates.
    
    [14] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of 
    the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
    
    [15] And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the 
    gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
    
    [16] And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: 
    and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length 
    and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
    
    [17] And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, 
    according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
    
    [18] And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure 
    gold, like unto clear glass.
    
    [19] And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner 
    of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the 
    third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
    
    [20] The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, 
    beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; 
    the twelfth, an amethyst.
    
    [21] And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one 
    pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
